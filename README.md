This project is my first attempt at using C#, developed with Microsoft Visual Studio. I created a custom version of the Flappy Bird game, allowing me to explore and experiment with different aspects of software development while learning the fundamentals.

My primary interest lies in web development, and I plan to pursue a career in this field. I'm also working on enhancing my skills in C-based languages, as well as Python and Java.
